# 칂i칞ekSepeti Test Automation

Hello游녦,This is my second Test Automation Project.I used Page Object Model in this project.

游댯Firstly,I created a class to get constant variables.

游댯Then i created 2 page classes(LoginPage and HomePage) that I need to on my project.

游댯And I defined the functions required for my test by making use of the constant variables that I have defined before in these classes.

游댯Finally,I called these functions in tests related to them.
