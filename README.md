# ÇiçekSepeti Test Automation

Hello👋,This is my second Test Automation Project.I used Page Object Model in this project.

🔵Firstly,I created a class to get constant variables.

🔵Then i created 2 page classes(LoginPage and HomePage) that I need to on my project.

🔵And I defined the functions required for my test by making use of the constant variables that I have defined before in these classes.

🔵Finally,I called these functions in tests related to them.
